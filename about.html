                <p>
                    Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars far away from us. These distant worlds come in a wide variety of sizes, compositions, and orbits.

                        <p>
                            When a planet passes in front of its star, it blocks a little bit of the star's light. Scientists see this small "blink" and know there's a planet there.

                        <p>
                            Sometimes, a planet’s gravity makes its star wobble a bit. This wobble changes the star's light color a little, and scientists can figure out a planet is pulling on it.

                            This is like taking a picture of a planet. It’s hard because the stars are so bright, but with special tools, scientists can sometimes see the planets.

                        <p>
                            When a planet and its star move in front of a faraway star, the light bends like a magnifying glass. This tells scientists there’s a planet.

            <h2>Significance</h2>
            <p>
                Exoplanets are significant for many reasons: they help us search for life, understand how planets form, explore the diversity of worlds, and learn about our own solar system. Overall, exoplanets are key to discovering more about the universe and our place in it!
